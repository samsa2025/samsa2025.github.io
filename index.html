                        <p>
                            The aim of SAMSA is to bring together researchers working on weighted automata, matrix reachability, noncommutative power series and symbolic dynamics in order to identify common open problems and ways to attack them by techniques across the mentioned areas.
                            The plan is to discuss recent results, emerging research directions, promising applications, open problems and stimulate cooperation among researchers working in these fields.

                                    I'll present Path-Complete control, a meta-optimization technique aiming at designing efficient optimization programs, initially introduced for stability analysis of switched linear systems, but later generalized to other control problems. These optimization programs are conveniently represented by an automaton. I'll review the seminal characterization results, which establish equivalence between universal automata and valid stability certificates. I'll provide a Lyapunov-theoretic interpretation of these stability criteria thanks to automata-theoretic tools. I will introduce the comparison problem, namely to characterize the partial order between path-complete criteria, in terms of their conservativeness. We will see that this partial order actually depends on the used template of Lyapunov functions, making another interesting connection between algebraic geometry and combinatorics. If time allows I will comment on generalization of the technique to other problems/systems in Control Engineering.

                                        I will introduce several open problems on Path-Complete Lyapunov Functions: from elementary ones to more open, prospective ones. They all blend symbolic dynamics, automata theory, algebraic geometry and (linear) dynamical systems theory.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For example, for practical purpose, it is crucial to understand when a particular Path-Complete Criterion is less conservative than another one. I'll focus on this problem, which is essentially an algebraic geometry problem. I will mention recent advances, which take into account the used template of candidate Lyapunov functions. We solved the comparison problem for several templates, making use of tools from automata theory (simulation,...), graph theory (Hall's marriage theorem), and convex geometry (duality,...). The general problem remains open, and I will comment on future directions.

                                        I'll also raise the question of the existence of a canonical form for Path-Complete criteria, and present a statistical version of the comparison problem mentioned above, which seems highly relevant in practice, but for which very little is understood for the moment.

                                    We study density of rational languages under shift invariant probability measures on spaces of
                                    two-sided infinite words, which generalizes the classical notion of density studied in formal languages
                                    and automata theory. The density for a language is defined as the limit in average (if it exists) of
                                    the probability that a word of a given length belongs to the language. We establish the existence of
                                    densities for all rational languages under all shift invariant measures. We also give explicit formulas
                                    under certain conditions, in particular when the language is aperiodic or when it is a group language. Our approach combines tools
                                    and ideas from semigroup theory and ergodic theory.<br>
                                    We list a number of open problems (joint work with Valérie Berthé, Herman Goulet-Ouellet,
                                    Carl-Fredrik Nyberg-Brodda and Karl Petersen)

                                    This talk will be a general survey of what can we decide about iterations of linear maps. Given a point x in euclidean space and a matrix A, we will ask which properties of the sequence Aⁿx are decidable. Equivalently, what can we formally verify for a class of programs made out of a single loop inside which only linear updates are allowed. I will begin by translating problems about weighted automata, Markov chains, and linear recurrence sequences, into questions about the sequence Aⁿx, and then continue with describing the principal techniques, focusing on open questions and where the difficulties lie.

                                    This tutorial will be about a single problem: given algebraic sets S, T, and a linear map A, does there exist a point in S whose orbit under A reaches T. One can ask more precisely: (1) reaches at least 1 time, (2) at least 10 times, (3) infinitely many times, (4) with positive frequency (e.g. 20% of the time the trajectory is in T). We do not yet know whether there exists a procedure for Problem (1). Problem (2) is undecidable. Problem (3) is known to be decidable for diagonalisable maps, and Problem (4) is decidable. I will explain the core ideas and techniques behind these results.

                                    We will survey some recent results concerning decision problems for probabilistic and quantum automata. Our aim will be to map the boundary between tractable problems, for which an efficient decision procedure is known, and those which are intractable, via reductions of NP-hard, PSPACE-hard, or undecidable problems. We will see a number of proof strategies, drawing on ideas from linear algebra, branches of number theory, complexity theory, and graph theory, and identify avenues for future research directions.

                                    We will see details of how to prove the undecidability of the injectivity problem for quantum automata using a reduction from the mixed Post’s correspondence problem from formal language theory. This will be done in two ways; firstly via a direct encoding and using free rotation groups and secondly via an encoding using rational polynomial packing functions, which removes the need to have a non-rational real algebraic initial state vector of the automata.
                                </details>

                        <h5>Participant talks: </h5>
                         <p>
                            We encourage contributed talks which <strong>do not fit in the format of more formal conferences</strong>, such as: 
                            <ul style="margin-bottom: 4px;">
                              <li>Reports on failed attempts</li>
                              <li>Presentations of old results that did not receive enough attention</li>
                              <li>Open-ended potential research directions</li>
                              <li>Unexpected connections between different areas</li>
                              <li>Open problems and possible lines of attack</li>
                            </ul>
                            Talks on recent results are also welcome.
                        </p>
